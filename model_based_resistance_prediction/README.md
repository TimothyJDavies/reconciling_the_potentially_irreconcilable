# MODELLING CODE
<pr> Code for RECONCILLING THE IRRECONCILABLE </pr> <br>
<pr> Note all genetic data available at NCBI PRJNA540750  </pr>

#### MODELLING WORKFLOW
<ol>
  <li> FIRST RUN THE CATEGORIZATION NOTEBOOK model_interpretations_of_genetic_features.ipynb => which creates model readable data from genetic/mic data</li>
  <li> RUN THE STATA MODELLING/PREDICTION DO FILE model_fitting_and_prediction</li>
  <li> MAKE THE GRAPH make_model_graph.ipynb </li>
  </ol>


######To create and run models from genetic and MIC data. Note also cross validation code included as extra. For detailed information on what each file is, see annotations in code.
